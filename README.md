# Mastercard Stock Price Prediction (Work in Progress)

This project explores predictive modeling of Mastercard’s stock prices using historical data.
Currently, the focus is on basic regression models and Random Forest with fundamental evaluation metrics. The goal is to iteratively improve performance with more advanced models and feature engineering.

🔹 Current Progress

✅ Imported and cleaned historical stock data

✅ Performed basic visualizations (price trends, distributions, correlations)

✅ Implemented Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor

✅ Evaluated models with R² and MAE

🔹 Next Steps

⏳ Add more robust evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAPE)

⏳ Explore additional models (XGBoost, LSTMs for time-series)

⏳ Hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest

⏳ Improve feature engineering (moving averages, technical indicators)

🔹 Tech Stack

Python, Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
