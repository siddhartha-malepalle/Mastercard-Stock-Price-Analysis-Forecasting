# Mastercard Stock Price Prediction (Work in Progress)  

This project explores **predictive modeling of Mastercard’s stock prices** using historical data.  
Currently, the focus is on **basic regression models** and **Random Forest** with fundamental evaluation metrics. The goal is to iteratively improve performance with more advanced models and feature engineering.  

---

## 🔹 Current Progress  
- ✅ Imported and cleaned historical stock data  
- ✅ Performed **basic visualizations** (price trends, distributions, correlations)  
- ✅ Implemented **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**  
- ✅ Evaluated models with **R² and MAE**  

---

## 🔹 Next Steps  
- ⏳ Add more robust evaluation metrics (**RMSE, MAPE**)  
- ⏳ Explore additional models (**XGBoost, LSTMs for time-series forecasting**)  
- ⏳ Perform hyperparameter tuning for **Random Forest**  
- ⏳ Improve feature engineering (moving averages, technical indicators)  

---

## 🔹 Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
